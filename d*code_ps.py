'''
So, the alterred algo would be like, we have a list of coordinates where the crystals are present, but we keep it hidden from the algo, in a sense, the algo will not know the entire information at the start - initially, just one crystal would be visible and as soon one crystal is visible, the next crystal would be visible (given) to the algo to create a path

1. generate an array of 20 crystals outside the cave and 14 inside the cave

2. data from the perception module would give data of the position of crystals and that of the obstacles - 2 in number - 2 containers, one placed diagonally opposite and the walls

3. each box dimensions = 20*20

4. the D* must be modified such a way that the goal is to reach a set of coordinates by a very efficient path
